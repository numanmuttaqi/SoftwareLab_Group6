The digitization of building models with semantic coherent geometry has become essential in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. This major update could help applications like facility management and urban planning. However, accurately inferring semantic information about building spaces remains a challenging task. This project aims to develop an automatic algorithm for recognition space utilization within the built environment using laser scanner point clouds and RGB images. The proposed methodology includes data acquisition, semantic enrichment, domain knowledge, and classification. The project demonstrated the ability to classify common space types (conference rooms, halls, lobbies, etc). However, due to the homogeneous dataset, the results were constrained and affected the accuracy. Future work will focus on enhancing dataset diversity and testing the model in real word scenarios to support broader use of the applications.
